Importing Stata files
Here, you'll gain expertise in importing Stata files as DataFrames using the pd.read_stata() function from pandas. The last exercise's file, 'disarea.dta', is still in your working directory.

Instructions

Use pd.read_stata() to load the file 'disarea.dta' into the DataFrame df.
Print the head of the DataFrame df.
Visualize your results by plotting a histogram of the column disa10. Weâ€™ve already provided this code for you, so just run it!


# Import sas7bdat package
from sas7bdat import SAS7BDAT

# Save file to a DataFrame: df_sas
with SAS7BDAT('sales.sas7bdat') as file:
    df_sas = file.to_data_frame()

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df_sas.head())

# Plot histogram of DataFrame features (pandas and pyplot already imported)
pd.DataFrame.hist(df_sas[['P']])
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
